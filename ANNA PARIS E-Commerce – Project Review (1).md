# ANNA PARIS E-Commerce – Project Review

## Available Features

*   **User Interface (UI/UX):** The website is designed based on the **“Quiet Luxury”** concept, utilizing a core color palette (Ink, Champagne, Platinum) and the Playfair Display font (for headings) paired with Lato (for body text). The design is fully responsive (Mobile-first Responsive Design) and uses Tailwind CSS for consistent spacing and sizing. It also features smooth animations throughout the site. (Completed)
*   **Header and Navigation:** Includes a Sticky Header that displays the logo centered on desktop (logo hidden on mobile). A hamburger menu is used to open a side navigation drawer on mobile. A full-screen Search Overlay is available, accessible via a shortcut (e.g., Ctrl+K), alongside icons for the user account, wishlist, and shopping cart, each displaying an item count badge. (Completed)
*   **Hero Section:** The homepage features a full-screen video background Hero Section with a parallax scrolling effect. A slogan or brand message is displayed over the video. (Completed)
*   **Homepage Elements:** The homepage dynamically pulls data from the database for several sections, such as Featured Collections, which are laid out in a multi-sized image grid, New Arrivals, a section showcasing product categories with scroll animations, and a section dedicated to the brand's Craftsmanship. All elements are designed according to the Quiet Luxury concept. (Completed)
*   **Product System:** Supports displaying all products categorized by type, with filtering options by product type or price range, and a search function. Each product has a detail page featuring a multi-view image gallery, options for product attributes (e.g., size, color, material), and stock availability information. Users can specify quantity and add products to the cart, as well as view related products within the same category. (Completed)
*   **Shopping Cart and Ordering System:** The shopping cart state is persisted across page refreshes (using Zustand and localStorage), ensuring items are not lost when the user leaves the site. Users can add, remove, or adjust product quantities in the cart. The system automatically calculates the total price and checks for free shipping eligibility. The Checkout process is structured sequentially (Shipping Address → Payment → Order Confirmation), includes form validation, and upon order confirmation, the system records the order in the live database, adjusts stock levels, and redirects the user to a success page displaying the order number. (Completed)
*   **User Account System:** For general customers, a User Account Dashboard is available to view past order history and details for each order. A message is displayed if no previous orders exist. The system manages user sessions using NextAuth and JWT. (Completed, but the login UI page is missing)
*   **Authentication System:** NextAuth is configured to support user authentication via Google OAuth and email/password credentials. It is integrated with the database via the Prisma Adapter and stores sessions as JSON Web Tokens, which can be used for authorization across different parts of the system. (Completed)
*   **Admin Panel:** An Admin Panel is available for system administrators, featuring a dashboard with key statistics (number of orders, products, customers, total revenue) and navigation to various management sections. Administrators can manage products (view list, edit details, delete, and set status like featured or hidden) and manage orders (view all orders, view details, and update shipping/processing status) via the interface. (Completed)
*   **Database and Sample Data:** The system uses Prisma to manage the database schema, covering models for users, products, categories, orders, and related relationships. SQLite is used for the development database, and a seed script is available to populate sample data, including over 50 sample products across 5 main categories for testing purposes. (Completed)
*   **API Endpoint:** RESTful APIs have been developed for various system functions, including:
    *   **Products:** API to fetch all product listings (with support for filtering by category/search term) and to fetch single product details by slug.
    *   **Orders:** API to create new orders (`POST /api/orders`), fetch user-specific order history, retrieve specific order details, and update order status (for administrators).
    *   **Admin:** APIs for product management (edit product details `PATCH /api/products/[id]`, delete product `DELETE /api/products/[id]`), fetching the list of product categories, and fetching all orders for administrators.
    *   **Authentication:** Endpoint for new user registration (`POST /api/auth/register`) and using NextAuth for login/logout.
    These APIs are connected to the database via Prisma and are fully operational. (Completed)
*   **Technology and Performance:** The project utilizes modern technologies, including Next.js 15 (App Router + Turbopack), React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS v4. Client-side state management is handled by Zustand. Framer Motion is used to enhance animation fluidity, and Lucide React icons are used for various graphics. The system is optimized for performance, with an initial JavaScript bundle size of approximately 178 kB and a build time of about 1.2 seconds. It supports Server-side Rendering (SSR) / Static Generation and automatic code splitting to minimize loaded file sizes, along with Next.js's built-in image optimization system. (Completed)

## Issues / Missing Elements

*   **Payment Gateway Integration:** Currently, there is no integration with a Payment Gateway (e.g., Stripe) in the checkout process. This prevents the website from accepting online payments directly. (Pending)
*   **Email Notification System:** There is no system in place to send order confirmation emails or any other necessary notifications to customers after a transaction, such as shipping confirmation. (Pending)
*   **Login/Registration UI Page:** Although NextAuth is configured to support login, a dedicated web page for general customers to sign up or log in to the system has not yet been developed. (Pending)
*   **Wishlist Account Connection:** The product Wishlist currently operates only on the user's local storage and is not linked to the actual user account. Consequently, the saved list is not synchronized with the user profile when switching devices or logging in on a new device. (Pending)
*   **Missing Admin Functionality:** The Admin Panel includes menu placeholders for “Customers” and “Content,” but these sections lack functional development. Administrators cannot currently view the customer list or edit static website content through the admin system. (Pending)
*   **Incomplete Content and Media:** Many text and image elements are still placeholders or sample data that require replacement before live deployment. This includes homepage text (brand headlines/slogans), collection images using samples, fictional customer reviews, product details (descriptions, materials, sizes) that do not match the actual products, and some product images that are stock photos not taken of the actual merchandise. (Pending)
*   **About/Contact Page Content:** The About Us and Contact pages have incomplete or temporary content. Real information (brand history, contact details, operating hours, etc.) in both Thai and English needs to be added. (Pending)
*   **SEO and Social Meta:** Metadata settings for SEO are incomplete. Website titles and descriptions are either default values or have not been optimized for the brand. Furthermore, no Open Graph image has been added for social media sharing. (Pending)
*   **Production Database:** The system currently uses SQLite for development, which is unsuitable for production environments. A real production database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL) has not been configured on the server, and proper migration scripts for deployment are missing. (Pending)
*   **Security Review:** Authorization and security checks require improvement. Some API endpoints may not have sufficient role-based access control (e.g., restricting product editing/deletion or viewing other users' orders to administrators only). Additionally, input validation and sanitization for user-submitted data are not fully implemented, posing a risk of errors or security vulnerabilities. (Incomplete)
*   **Code Quality Issues:** Some parts of the code use the `any` type in TypeScript instead of explicit typing, and minor ESLint warnings (e.g., declared but unused variables) remain unresolved. (Requires further improvement)

## Recommendations for Production Readiness

*   **Integrate Payment Gateway:** A Payment Gateway (e.g., Stripe) should be integrated into the website's Checkout process to allow customers to pay instantly via credit card or other online methods. This requires developing the UI for payment input, connecting to the service provider's API (e.g., Stripe), and setting up webhooks to receive payment status and proceed with the order. (Recommended)
*   **Implement Email Notification System:** Add functionality to send order confirmation emails to customers upon successful purchase, as well as other essential notifications (e.g., shipping tracking number, password reset). This involves configuring an SMTP server or external email service and creating branded Anna Paris email templates. (Recommended)
*   **Create Login/Registration Pages:** Develop web pages for user sign-up and login. These forms should connect to the existing NextAuth system, include proper data validation (email/password), and display appropriate error messages. Once logged in, users should be able to access the User Account Dashboard and other restricted functions. Social Login options (e.g., Google login) should also be fully implemented. (Recommended)
*   **Replace Placeholder Data:** Before going live, all content must be updated with real data from the content team. This involves replacing temporary text in `content.json` and other parts of the website with validated Thai/English copy, and substituting all sample images with high-quality product and brand media. (Recommended)
*   **Complete About/Contact Page Content:** Populate the company information pages with comprehensive content, such as the Anna Paris brand story in both Thai and English on the About Us page, and complete contact details (address, phone number, social media) and store operating hours (if applicable) on the Contact page. (Recommended)
*   **Improve SEO and Metadata:** Optimize the website's metadata for live usage. This includes setting appropriate page titles and descriptions that reflect the brand and contain relevant keywords. Implement Open Graph data (`og:title`, `og:description`) and prepare a dedicated image for link sharing (e.g., `og-image.png`). Additionally, a sitemap (`sitemap.xml`) and `robots.txt` file should be created to assist search engine indexing. (Recommended)
*   **Migrate to Production Database:** Prepare the production database system by setting up PostgreSQL or MySQL on a live server. Subsequently, migrate the Prisma schema to the new database and test the connection. Establish clear migration and seeding procedures for deployment (e.g., using Prisma migration scripts) to ensure a smooth system rollout. (Recommended)
*   **Enhance System Security:** Ensure that all endpoints that modify or delete data have correct authorization checks (e.g., only administrators with `role=admin` can edit/delete products or view other customers' orders). Furthermore, strengthen server-side input validation using libraries like Zod or Yup to verify the format of incoming data before saving it to the database, mitigating risks from incorrect data or attacks. (Recommended)
*   **Connect Wishlist to User Account:** Refine the Wishlist system to be linked to user account data in the database. When a user logs in, their saved Wishlist items should be fetched from their account, and any changes should be saved back to the server, allowing the favorite list to follow the user across devices. This data can also be leveraged for marketing purposes with a CRM system. (Recommended)
*   **Review and Fix Code Quality Issues:** Conduct a thorough code review to eliminate the use of `any` in TypeScript by defining explicit types for all critical functions/variables, and resolve any outstanding ESLint warnings. This is crucial for improving the quality of the codebase for future scalability. Additionally, write a suite of tests (Unit Tests/Integration Tests) for core functions (e.g., price calculation, add-to-cart logic) and critical API endpoints to ensure bug-free operation. (Recommended)
*   **Comprehensive System Testing:** Before going live, perform End-to-End system testing across all steps: product browsing, adding to cart, completing the Checkout process, and order verification in the Admin Panel. Test on various devices and browsers for compatibility and simulate edge cases (e.g., out-of-stock items, network failure during transactions) to ensure robust error handling. (Recommended)
*   **Set Up Tracking and Analytics:** For a live system, installing Analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics) or other analysis tools is essential for collecting user statistics (visitor count, conversion rate, click behavior, etc.). This data will be valuable for future marketing and user experience improvements. Monitoring or error tracking systems (e.g., Sentry) should also be configured to alert administrators of production errors. (Recommended)

## Future Enhancements

*   **Product Review and Rating System:** Add a feature allowing customers to leave reviews and ratings for purchased products. This will help build social proof and increase product credibility on the website. (Recommended)
*   **Loyalty and Promotion System:** Implement a membership system with loyalty points or tiered membership levels (Loyalty Program) to encourage repeat purchases. Examples include accumulating points for rewards or defining a VIP tier for frequent buyers. A coupon/promo code system should also be considered for marketing and sales stimulation. (Recommended)
*   **Advanced Search:** Improve the product search system for greater efficiency and accuracy, such as integrating a Thai-language supported Full-text search or using an external service like Algolia for product indexing and faster search results. (Recommended)
*   **Multi-language and Multi-currency Support:** If the brand plans international expansion, the system should be fully developed to support multiple languages (multi-language support), allowing users to switch website languages and providing content in various languages. Multi-currency support is also vital for international buyers. Users should be able to select their preferred currency for pricing display, or prices should be shown in multiple currencies based on the user's location. (Recommended)
*   **B2B Features (Wholesale):** To support wholesale customers or business partners, specific features may be added, such as a dedicated registration and login system for B2B clients, setting wholesale pricing different from retail, bulk ordering via file upload or multi-item selection, and offering payment credit terms for corporate accounts. (Recommended)
*   **Admin Backend Improvements:** Add a Customer Management section to the Admin Panel, allowing administrators to view the member list, edit profiles, or set user permissions. Develop a Content Management section for various web pages (e.g., About Us, Contact, or other Landing Pages) to allow the content team to conveniently edit text and images via the system. Advanced reporting/dashboards (e.g., sales reports, top-selling products, customer purchasing behavior) should also be considered to aid business analysis. (Recommended)
*   **Media and File Upload Management:** Enhance the Admin Panel to allow administrators to directly upload new product images or other media files (currently, they might need to input image URLs). (Recommended)
*   **Admin Notification System:** Develop a real-time notification system in the Admin Panel (e.g., a Notification Bell) to alert administrators of new orders, successful payments, or critical system errors. (Recommended)
